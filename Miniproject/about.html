            <p>An About Us page is a section on a website that provides information about a company, organization, or
                individual. It's an opportunity to tell
                your brand's story, share your vision, introduce team members, and outline your history, values, and
                achievements. This is where you build trust and credibility with customers.
                An About Us page is a section on a website that provides information about a company, organization, or

                In Shopify’s customer trust research, we found shoppers navigate to an About Us page to learn more about
                the brand and the people behind the products. According to one study, 59% of consumers surveyed said
                they would more likely purchase from a brand they trust. That number jumps to 79% of younger Gen Z
                consumers. Your About Page should address those two curiosities shoppers have to help them with decision
                making.
